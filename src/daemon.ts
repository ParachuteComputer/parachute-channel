 * parachute-agent daemon — the transport-agnostic orchestrator.
 *
 * Runs as a long-lived HTTP server (launchd, systemd, or manual). It loads a
 * channel registry (name → transport), starts each transport, and routes
 * inbound traffic to the bridges subscribed to that channel. Bridges connect
 * via SSE (`/events?channel=<name>`) for inbound and POST outbound to the HTTP
 * API with a `channel` field.
 *
 * Telegram is one transport behind the registry; the daemon core touches no
 * platform API directly.
 *
 * Port resolution (see `resolvePort`): the hub supervisor's injected `PORT`
 * wins, then the `PARACHUTE_AGENT_PORT` override (legacy `PARACHUTE_CHANNEL_PORT`
 * still honored), then the compiled-in canonical default 1941. The daemon binds
 * AND self-registers the resolved port, so the supervisor's probe/proxy and the
 * bound port never disagree (agent#41).

 *      and the proxy routes to a dead port (agent#41).
 *   2. `PARACHUTE_AGENT_PORT` — manual override for a daemon run outside the
 *      supervisor. Falls back to the legacy `PARACHUTE_CHANNEL_PORT` (the
 *      pre-rename env var; still honored during the channel→agent transition).
 *   3. `1941` — the compiled-in canonical default.
 *
 * Pre-#41 the daemon read only `PARACHUTE_CHANNEL_PORT`, so it ignored the
 * supervisor's `PORT` and bound 1941 regardless — the supervisor's injected
 * port and the bound port could disagree, stranding the proxy. Honoring `PORT`
 * first closes that gap.
 *
 * Read at call time (not at import) so tests can drive each tier deterministically.
 *
 * Uses `||` (not `??`) for the fall-through so an EMPTY-string env value falls
 * through rather than being treated as "set": `PORT=""` with `??` would yield
 * `parseInt("")` = NaN and bind port 0 / garbage. `||` skips the empty string
 * to the next tier — matches vault's defensive `parseInt(...) || ... || DEFAULT`.

 * which has no resident process to survive a restart, resumes routing inbound to an

 * note (`metadata.session`), so that next turn reads it back + `--resume`s the prior
 * conversation, so no message is lost in the restart window beyond the normal
 * inbound-trigger durability.
 *
 * INTERACTIVE specs are SKIPPED — their tmux sessions survive a daemon restart on

 * swept, a crash mid-spawn, a leaked test fixture, a hand-copied dir). Re-registering
 * a programmatic agent whose wake channel ISN'T in the live channels config would
 * resurrect a PHANTOM agent — one with nothing to receive for (no live channel feeds
 * it inbound), confusing the operator and the agent list. So we re-register ONLY a
 * spec whose wake channel STILL EXISTS in `channels` (the live channels.json-derived
 * map); a spec for a missing channel is SKIPPED with a one-line notice, making any
 * orphaned/leaked spec dir inert. The wake channel is keyed exactly as the registry
 * keys it (`normalizeChannel(spec.channels[0]).name` — see `ProgrammaticAgentRegistry`).
 * A spec with an EMPTY channels array is also skipped (it has no wake channel to key /

// it against the hub's JWKS. Scope split: subscribing to inbound events is
// `agent:read`; sending anything out (reply/react/edit/permission/download)
// is `agent:write`.
//
// Layer 2 — human / chat UI — gates the http-ui transport's `send` (POST,
// `agent:send`, Bearer) with `requireScope`. The browser SSE streams
// (`/ui/events`, `/api/channels/<ch>/turn-events`, `agent:read`) gate on a
// ONE-TIME ticket (`requireSseTicket`) instead of a `?token=<JWT>` query —
// `EventSource` can't set a header, and a JWT in a URL leaks into access logs
// (agent#25). The page mints the ticket at `POST /api/ui/sse-ticket` (Bearer,
// agent:read) and opens `…?ticket=<nonce>`; the ticket is single-use + ≤60s and
// carries only the minting token's scopes.
